The Google Hangout app that lets you watch videos hosted on external servers in sync with friends.

Currently only supports Firefox because the Google Hangout API only seems to support files hosted on secure external servers (i.e. servers that support https). Chrome doesn't play nice with this, Firefox seems okay.

## For Developers

Email me if you want to help with development (kevindconley AT gmail DOT com).

Push to the "gh-pages" branch to update the files at http://kevincon.github.com/movienight.
